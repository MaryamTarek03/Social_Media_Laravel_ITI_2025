## ðŸŒ¿ Git Workflow & Feature Development

### Creating Feature Branches

```bash
# 1. Make sure you're on main branch and up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/authentication
git checkout -b feature/posts
git checkout -b feature/comments
git checkout -b feature/reactions
git checkout -b feature/follows

# Alternative: Create branch without switching
# Create
git branch feature/your-feature-name
# Switch
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
```

### Working on Features

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch

# See file changes
git status

# Add changes to staging
git add .
# Or add specific files
git add app/Http/Controllers/PostController.php

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Add post creation functionality"

# Push feature branch to remote
git push origin feature/posts
```

### Merging Features

```bash
# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Merge your feature (or create Pull Request on GitHub)
git merge feature/posts

# Push merged changes
git push origin main

# Delete feature branch (optional)
git branch -d feature/posts
git push origin --delete feature/posts
```
